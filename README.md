# React Native: Uninitialized State Access

This repository demonstrates a common React Native bug: accessing state variables before they've been initialized.  The `Bug.js` file showcases the issue, while `BugSolution.js` presents a solution using the `useEffect` hook to ensure state is ready before rendering.

## Problem
Attempting to use state values before they're properly set by the component leads to undefined values and application errors. This frequently occurs when using asynchronous operations like fetching data.

## Solution
The `useEffect` hook allows us to conditionally render content only after the state has been updated. By using `useEffect` with a dependency array, we ensure the component waits for the data to arrive before rendering the dependent part of the UI.
